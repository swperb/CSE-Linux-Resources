## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for the CSE and Linux Resources on behalf of the CSE department at Mississippi State University. This project serves the intention to expand on classes offered within the department, as well as topics and concepts within those classes. I plan to expand not only on the class information, but also topics outside of the classes which may include, but are not limited to, Linux, IDEs, text editors, compilers, Git/GitHub, etc. Throughout the duration of the project, I will fill this repository with resources and information I find supportive of the purpose of this project.

## User Manual

### Nav Bar
The navigation bar is built to help steer new users in the right direction, organizing information in an intuitive way. Information is split into course materials, miscellaneous topics and tutorials, and information on Linux/UNIX systems.

### Search Bar
The search bar is included within the nav bar and allows users to search keywords of information queries, and returns all instances of the keyword(s). In the example below, I have begun typing the keyword `CSE` and the search bar will immediately return all instances of courses, topics, and information containing the letters `CSE`. Queries are not case-sensitive or order-sensitive.
