# CSELinuxTutorials

Welcome to the repository for the CSE/Linux Tutorials on behalf of the CSE department at Mississippi State University. This project serves the intention to expand on classes offered within the department, as well as topics and concepts within those classes. I plan to expand not only on the class information, but also topics outside of the classes which may include, but are not limited to, Linux, IDEs, text editors, compilers, Git/GitHub, etc. Throughout the duration of the project, I will fill this repository with resources and information I find supportive of the purpose of this project.
